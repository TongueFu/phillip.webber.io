	<p id = "pAbout">My name is Phillip Weber, I am a transgender woman who grew up in Rochester Hills, Michigan. I first got my start in video production by working the audio/video equipment at a local church when I was younger and from then on, I was entranced by the world of video production. Throughout high school I worked at a bunch of different shows around town running their audio/video equipment as well as still running the local churches equipment. As I grew up and went to college, I always had a feeling id end up in the Television and Digital Media Production program at Ferris State University, but it still took me a year to decide that itâ€™s what I wanted to do. As my senior year is coming to a close, I am very excited for the next big project that I will be a part of as well as the next company that I will be apart of. </p>
